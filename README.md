🔐 Security Highlights
Password Hashing:
All user passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database, preventing plain-text password exposure.

JWT-Based Stateless Authentication:
Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), enabling secure, stateless session management without server-side session storage.

Role-Based Authorization:
Custom authorization middleware enforces access control based on user roles (super_admin, tenant_admin, user), ensuring users can only access permitted resources.

Tenant Data Isolation:
Strict tenant isolation is implemented using tenant_id filtering at the application level, preventing cross-tenant data access.

Audit Logging:
Critical system actions such as tenant creation, project creation, and task updates are logged in an audit_logs table for traceability and security monitoring.
